# GRPC is a language agnostic, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.

## The main benefits of gRPC are:
1. Modern, high-performance, lightweight RPC framework.
2. Contract-first API development, using Protocol Buffers by default, allowing for language agnostic implementations.
3. Tooling available for many languages to generate strongly-typed servers and clients.
4. Supports client, server, and bi-directional streaming calls.
5. Reduced network usage with Protobuf binary serialization.

## These benefits make gRPC ideal for:
1. Lightweight microservices where efficiency is critical.
2. Polyglot systems where multiple languages are required for development.
3. Point-to-point real-time services that need to handle streaming requests or responses.
